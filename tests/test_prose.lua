-- tests/test_prose.lua — the US-English prose gate (localization-§5).
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES. That no authored file this repository tracks carries a British spelling from
-- localization-§5's published `BRITISH` list, once the `ALLOWED` US words that contain one of those
-- substrings have been taken out as whole words. Source, locale files, the TOC, README.md and every
-- document under docs/ — the whole authored set, read from git.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS, in this repo specifically. It did not, until 2026-09-22. The collection-wide
-- sweep of that day found 17 lines across 11 files -- the fewest of any addon here, which is a
-- reason to gate it rather than a reason not to: a tree this close to clean stays clean only if
-- something says so on every run. `luacheck` does not read English, and every other suite here reads
-- behavior.
--
-- BOTH LISTS ARE COPIED WHOLE, AND NOTHING IS ADDED. localization-§5 is explicit that a gate MUST
-- carry every `BRITISH` entry and every `ALLOWED` entry and MUST NOT carry an entry the section does
-- not publish, because a private list is a coverage claim no reader outside this repo can check —
-- LibKa0s shipped six substrings for months and stayed green while `CANCELLED` went out in chat text
-- a player reads. If a sweep here finds a British form the published list misses, it is amended in
-- the standard first and arrives here on the next sync; it does not get added locally.
--
-- IT FAILS RATHER THAN PASSES WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK. No `io.popen`, no git, an unreadable tracked file
-- — every one of those is a failure, not a skip. A gate that goes quiet when it is blind reports
-- success, which is worse than not existing. Same bargain tests/_kit/test_eol.lua and
-- tests/test_layout_cap.lua strike.

-- Named directory by directory and file by file, as localization-§5 requires, so the exclusion list
-- cannot quietly grow by widening a pattern. Four categories and nothing else:
--
--   * vendored code this repo MUST NOT edit — `libs/` and `tests/_kit/`. A kit or library problem is
--     a finding to fix in LibKa0s and re-vendor; tests/test_vendor_sync.lua holds that line.
--   * frozen dated bundles, which are the record of what a tool said on the day rather than authored
--     prose, and are not rewritten. There is no CHANGELOG.md here to add — documentation-§1 permits
--     one only in a Ka0s-owned library repo.
--   * `locales/enGB.lua`, which is what a British locale file is for. This repo ships enUS only; the
--     carve-out is written down here rather than discovered by whoever adds the file.
--   * this file, which quotes every forbidden spelling in order to forbid it.
--
-- docs/superpowers/ is deliberately NOT excluded. Its plans and specs are dated, but they are
-- authored prose that people still read, not a tool's frozen output, and they are clean today.
