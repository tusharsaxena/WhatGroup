-- tests/test_register.lua — the deviation register's citations are checkable, so they are checked.
--
-- `documentation-§3` gives a ratified deviation exactly one home, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
-- `## Documented deviations`, and `audit-review-history` says what a row owes: a rule citation that
-- resolves against the current standard, a re-check trigger a reader can evaluate, and an evidence
-- id that resolves. The first is a human's to read and the second is prose. The third is not, and
-- this suite is the third.

-- ── The deviation register's own citations resolve ─────────────────────────────

-- `audit-review-history`'s third MUST: an id a register row cites in **Why** has to resolve -- a
-- deviation id into `docs/audits/`, a finding id into `docs/reviews/`, an issue number onto this
-- repo. An id that resolves to nothing is worse than no citation at all, because it reads as
-- evidence and leads to none, and it survives every re-read by a maintainer who knows the shape of
-- an id and never goes looking for what it names.
--
-- The check is deliberately NOT "the string appears somewhere under `docs/audits/`". A bundle that
-- REPORTS a dead citation quotes the dead id while doing so, so a substring search goes green on
-- the very defect it was written for -- `testing-§12`'s failure mode, sitting inside the gate for
-- it. What counts is the id being ASSIGNED: standing at the head of a markdown table cell, a
-- heading or a bullet, which is where every bundle in this repo puts a row's own id, and where
-- prose that merely mentions one never puts it.
--
-- Scope is the **deviation** id -- this repo's own audit-bundle prefix. A review finding is cited
-- in the register too, and some rows use a repo-local shorthand for one (`WG-R-NN`); the
-- shorthand is a whole-repo naming convention rather than a register defect, so it is out of this
-- gate and its expansion is stated in the register's own preamble instead.
