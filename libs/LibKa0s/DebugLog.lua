-- LibKa0s-DebugLog-1.0 — the on-screen debug console: two formatters, a buffer, a window, and the
-- one seam that turns logging on and off.
--
-- The console is the most-duplicated thing in the collection: seven hand-transcribed copies of a
-- window the standard already specifies down to the hex codes, drifting one digit at a time. What
-- is genuinely per-addon is only the CONTENT of what gets logged — so everything else lives here
-- and the host supplies a descriptor.
--
-- Two decisions worth stating up front, because both look like details and neither is:
--
-- The enable flag is NOT stored here. The host owns it and the library reads and writes it through
-- an isEnabled/setEnabled pair. A library that kept its own copy would leave two truths about
-- whether logging is on, and the host's is the one its slash command and its settings panel read.
--
-- Every frame is per-instance and every frame global is derived from the descriptor's `name`. A
-- lib-level singleton would give two addons one console — and, worse, one UISpecialFrames
-- registration, so Esc would close whichever window registered last.
--
-- Depends on LibStub and LibKa0s-Core-1.0, and on no addon framework.

-- Refuse rather than degrade when Core is missing or too old, so a broken vendored copy makes this
-- module absent and the host's own setup stub reports that honestly.

--
-- A forwarder rather than `lib.MakeCloseButton = core.MakeCloseButton`, and the indirection is the
-- point: LibStub upgrades a major IN PLACE, so the `core` TABLE stashed above survives a Core minor
-- bump while the FUNCTION on it is replaced. A host carrying a newer Core.lua beside an unchanged
-- DebugLog.lua returns early at the guard and never re-snapshots — so a copied value would leave this
-- console drawing the older Core's button while lib.MODULES.Core truthfully reports the newer minor.
-- Resolving through the table at CALL time keeps the two halves honest, and costs one call frame

--- Build a console for one host.
---
--- Descriptor:
---   name        string    required. Seeds the frame globals `<name>DebugWindow`,
---                         `<name>DebugCopyWindow` and `<name>DebugCopyScroll`. Two hosts sharing a
---                         name would clobber each other's globals and each other's Esc handler.
---   title       string    required. The human title; the library appends its own " — Debug".
---   font        string    required. Path to the monospace font the console renders in. Required
---                         rather than defaulted because a nil here raises inside SetFont, halfway
---                         through building a window that is then un-closable.
---   fontSize    number    optional, default 10.
---   isEnabled   function  required. Reads the host's logging flag. The library never stores it.
---   setEnabled  function  required. Writes it. Always handed a real boolean.
---   print       function  optional. Where the chat acknowledgement goes. Defaults to the chat
---                         frame, untagged — a host that wants its own tag passes its printer,
---                         which is what every Ka0s addon does.
---   safeToString function optional, defaults to Core's. Every logged value goes through it, so a
---                         combat-protected value renders rather than raising downstream.
---   initSummary function  optional. Returns one line naming version/schema/profile. The library
---                         owns WHEN it is emitted; only the host can know what it says.
---   onVisibilityChanged function optional. Fired on both OnShow and OnHide, so a host can repaint
---                         a settings panel whose checkbox mirrors the console's visibility.
---   slash       string    optional. Composes the checkbox tooltip's "<slash> debug" reference.
---   L           table     optional. Locale override, keyed to lib.STRINGS.
---   skin        table     optional. Overrides Core.SKIN.
---   applySkin   function  optional, minor 4. function(frame) — owns the whole skin job for BOTH
---                         windows, replacing the library's own. For a host whose window chrome is
---                         more than a backdrop (an inner-border child frame, a title tint, a
---                         divider tint); `skin` is a table and can only reach backdrop fields.
---                         Called on the fully-built frame, after the Hide and the Esc wiring.
---   makeCloseButton function optional, minor 4. function(parent, onClick) -> button or nil.
---                         Overrides Core's x on BOTH windows. May answer nil, as Core's own
---                         does. The Copy/Clear offsets are derived from the returned button's
---                         width, so a wider button pushes them out of its way.
---
---                         RARELY THE RIGHT FIELD, and it has no consumer today. These are the
---                         LIBRARY's windows, so they wear the library's close glyph; a host
---                         whose own main window closes with something else MUST NOT push that
---                         difference onto them (standalone-windows in the Ka0s WoW Addon
---                         Standard). Two adopters passed their 24x24 class-coloured x here
---                         and shipped diagnostic windows that did not match the other three's.
---                         Pass this only for a close control that is genuinely DIFFERENT IN
---                         KIND — not merely the host's own.
