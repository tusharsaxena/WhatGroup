-- other's module-scope locals. What is left is what a schema ROW becomes. `O.RenderTabbedSchema`

-- ── the landing page ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Three blocks, one file-local each, assembled by O.BuildLandingPage. Promoted out of three hosts
-- that each carried a function literally named Helpers.BuildMainContent rendering the same page
-- with the same four constants; the only differences were the logo path and where the one-liner
-- came from, which is why both are spec DATA here.

--- The logo block. A full-width SimpleGroup with its layout suppressed, holding a texture anchored
--- TOPLEFT at its native size, so the art renders pixel-exact and left-aligned regardless of how
--- wide the panel is.
---
--- The `.frame` handle and the texture it hands back are both guarded, for the same reason every
--- other widget touch in this file is: an AceGUI widget mock has no backing frame, and a
--- CreateTexture that answers nil is the shape a stubbed one takes. It matters MORE here than
--- elsewhere — BuildLandingPage runs under the renderer's pcall, so one raise on the logo prints
--- RENDER_FAILED and costs the notes and every section too, i.e. the whole page for the sake of a
--- picture. The group and its spacer are added either way, so a missing texture leaves a gap where
--- the art goes rather than re-flowing everything under it.
---
--- A TEXTURE OUTLIVES THE WIDGET THAT DREW IT, and that is the whole reason this is not three
--- lines. AceGUI POOLS its widget frames: Release hides a frame and hands the same one back on the
--- next Create. A texture created on it is not a widget, so nothing releases it and nothing hides
--- it — it rides the frame into the pool and reappears the next time that frame is handed out. So
--- a host with a logo grew a SECOND logo partway down its own landing page, intermittently,
--- depending only on pool order: the stale texture belonged to a SimpleGroup being used for
--- something else entirely. BuildLandingPage's ClearScroll cannot help, because there is no widget
--- there to clear.
---
--- Two halves, and both are needed. The texture is kept ON the frame and reused, so a frame that
--- comes back for another logo cannot accumulate a second one; and it is hidden when the widget is
--- released, so a frame that comes back for anything else does not show it. `SetCallback` is safe
--- here because AceGUI fires "OnRelease" BEFORE it clears a widget's callbacks, and this one is set
--- fresh on every acquisition.

  -- same line. Section headings span the full width, and every row is followed by a small vertical
  -- spacer.
  --
  --   solo        render this row alone in the left half of its own line. For visual pivots.
  --   wide        render this row alone at FULL width, spanning both columns. NOT what `solo`
  --               does -- solo renders alone in the LEFT HALF -- and named to match RenderGrid's
  --               field of the same meaning rather than redefining solo, which would silently
  --               widen every solo row in nine shipped addons.
  --   startsLine  flush the pending line BEFORE this row, so a declared pair -- a color swatch and
  --               its "use class color" companion (options-ui-§17), the first row of a composed
  --               group -- is guaranteed to land as [left][right] and can never be split across
  --               two lines by an odd number of widgets above it. Without it the parity of every
  --               pair is a property of how many rows happen to precede it, which is a thing every
  --               author was counting by hand.
  --   subgroup    a heading drawn INSIDE a group (options-ui-§7). `group` is what a tabbed page
  --               partitions its strip on; `subgroup` is what breaks one tab into named blocks
  --               when it mixes control types. Drawn even under `noHeadings`, which suppresses the
  --               GROUP heading only.
  --   skipRender  keep the row in the schema (so resets and the CLI still see it) but let the host
  --               draw it bespoke — a header checkbox, say.
  --   afterGroup  { [groupName] = fn(ctx) } fired once PER RENDER, after that group's last row is
  --               flushed, so inline action buttons always start on a fresh line. The table is
  --               read-only to the library: hoist it to a constant and re-render freely.
  --   pairWith    { [path] = maker(ctx, rowGroup) } attaches a non-schema widget as the RIGHT half
  --               of a named path's row. Once per render (and, like afterGroup, never mutated),
  --               and only when that path is currently the lone
  --               widget on its row — attaching to a row that already has two would make it
  --               three-wide and break the 50/50 split for the rest of the page.
  --   opts        { noHeadings = true } suppresses the automatic Section heading, for a page
  --               whose sections are drawn as tabs instead (options-ui-§13). Omitted by every
  --               untabbed caller, which is why it is a fifth argument rather than a field on
  --               the ctx: a page's tabbedness is a property of THIS render, and a ctx flag
  --               would leak it into the next one.
  --               { disabled = true } (minor 16) draws every widget of the call disabled -- the
  --               rows, and the buttons an afterGroup or pairWith hook draws -- for a page whose
  --               subject does not apply (a Bars page over an icons container). It rides on
  --               `ctx.__renderDisabled` for the call's duration only, for the reason just given.
  --   disabledIf  (a row field) a settings path, or from minor 16 a predicate function(row) ->
  --               bool, whose truth draws the row disabled. Honored by every maker (only the
  --               color picker read it before minor 16) and re-evaluated on every refresh.

  --- host does not render through this engine at all, which today is the AceConfig-drawn Profiles
  --- page: it needs no mechanism here, because it never reaches this function. No opt-out flag is
  --- offered -- a flag is a thing an addon can set for the wrong reason, and there would be no way
  --- to see it in a test.
  ---
  --- A page with NO groups is a different decision: there is nothing to name a tab with, and a
  --- strip of zero tabs is not a strip. That is an authoring defect (anti-patterns #69), so it is
  --- REPORTED and then rendered untabbed -- a blank page under an empty strip is a worse failure
  --- than a strip-less one.
  ---
  --- With no AceGUI there is nothing to draw AT ALL: EnsureScroll answers nil and every maker in
  --- this file refuses, so this reports an empty tab list and draws nothing -- which is what
