--- CreateTexture that answers nil is the shape a stubbed one takes. It matters MORE here than

--- RENDER_FAILED and costs the notes and every section too, i.e. the whole page for the sake of a

  -- ── the two-column flow engine ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  --
  -- Widgets are paired into 50/50 Flow rows, each row wrapped in a full-width SimpleGroup so
  -- AceGUI's layout pass gives both children exactly half the panel width and breaks them onto the
  -- same line. Section headings span the full width, and every row is followed by a small vertical
  -- spacer.
  --
  --   solo        render this row alone in the left half of its own line. For visual pivots.
  --   skipRender  keep the row in the schema (so resets and the CLI still see it) but let the host
  --               draw it bespoke — a header checkbox, say.
  --   afterGroup  { [groupName] = fn(ctx) } fired once PER RENDER, after that group's last row is
  --               flushed, so inline action buttons always start on a fresh line. The table is
  --               read-only to the library: hoist it to a constant and re-render freely.
  --   pairWith    { [path] = maker(ctx, rowGroup) } attaches a non-schema widget as the RIGHT half
  --               of a named path's row. Once per render (and, like afterGroup, never mutated),
  --               and only when that path is currently the lone
  --               widget on its row — attaching to a row that already has two would make it
  --               three-wide and break the 50/50 split for the rest of the page.

  --- Render an EXPLICIT list of rows. Taking a list rather than a page key is what lets a host
  --- render a filtered subset (a mirrored unit's partition) through the same engine.
  --- Lay out arbitrary widgets two per row, in the order given.
  ---
  --- The sibling of RenderRows, and deliberately not the same function. RenderRows is
  --- SCHEMA-driven: it walks declared rows, emits a Section when `group` changes, and pairs them
  --- automatically. This one is CALLER-driven — the caller decides what goes in each cell and in
  --- what order, and a cell may be a schema row or a bespoke widget.
  ---
  --- That distinction is what a host needs for a list whose LENGTH is not known from the schema:
  --- one checkbox per macro, per unit, per spell. Every such list was previously a hand-rolled
  --- copy of this loop in the host, which is exactly the duplication this library exists to end.
  ---
  --- Each item is either a schema row, or `{ make = function(ctx, parent, relativeWidth) end }`
  --- for a bespoke widget. `wide = true` breaks the item onto its own full-width row.
