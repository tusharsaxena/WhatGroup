--
-- The value here is not the bucket counter. It is the PROTOCOL: two combat-gated measurement
-- windows over the same fight, differing only in whether the host addon is inert, with load order
-- and shared-frame ownership held fixed. WoW's own Addon Profiler cannot answer "is this cost even
-- ours?", because it bills a shared library's dispatch frame to whichever addon created it — so
-- enabling and disabling addons moves the blame around. Suspending changes only whether the host's
-- code runs.
--
-- Every instance owns its own frames. A lib-level shared frame would reproduce that exact
-- attribution pathology: the measuring instrument corrupting the attribution it exists to fix.
--
-- Depends on LibStub and LibKa0s-Core-1.0, and on NO ADDON FRAMEWORK — that second half is the part
-- worth protecting. Core embeds nothing either, so an addon that is not on the Ace substrate can
-- still adopt this probe; what the Core dependency costs is one vendored sibling file, and
-- re-vendoring is whole-folder, so it is never separately missing in practice.

-- Refuse rather than degrade when Core is missing or too old. Failing here means the host's own
-- setup stub reports "perf is not installed" honestly, instead of the probe registering and then
-- nil-erroring mid-run in whichever addon the user happened to be using.

  -- ── Measurement windows + the FPS sampler ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  --
  -- An experiment is a sequence of explicitly-armed, COMBAT-GATED windows:
  --
  --     perf.Start(label)     begin the experiment (samples nothing yet)
  --     perf.Measure("a")     arm window A - starts the moment combat does, ends when it does
  --     perf.Measure("b")     arm window B - same, with the host suspended
  --     perf.Stop()           report both windows and hand back the record
  --
  -- Why windows rather than sampling continuously and splitting by suspend state (the original
  -- design): continuous sampling silently folds every difference between the arms into the result.
  -- Two real captures were lost to exactly that - one where the active arm was ~78% combat against a
  -- suspended arm at ~100%, and one where the arms ran 72.3s and 59.2s. Both produced a delta that
  -- described the environment rather than the addon. A window that opens on PLAYER combat and closes
  -- when it ends measures a comparable slice by construction, and lets the user walk to the pull,
  -- reset a dungeon, or wait out a respawn between arms without contaminating anything.
  --
  -- Combat is read from UnitAffectingCombat("player") on the sampler's own OnUpdate rather than from
  -- the combat EVENTS, deliberately: P.Suspend() calls the host's suspend callback, which is free to
  -- unregister the host's event frames - so window B, the suspended arm, would never see
  -- PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED fire if this polled events instead. Polling a cheap C call on a frame that
  -- only exists during an experiment sidesteps that entirely.
  --
  -- Window A maps to the `active` arm and window B to `suspended`, so the record schema and the delta
  -- computation are unchanged. `measure b` suspends the host and `measure a` resumes it, so the two
  -- windows differ by the host and nothing else - there is no way to forget the suspend.
