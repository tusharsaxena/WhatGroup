-- LibKa0s-Options-1.0 — the Blizzard settings-canvas shell: the panel factory, the page registry,
-- the lazy Defaults button, and the reset/refresh trio every Ka0s addon's options UI runs on.
--
-- Three files, one major. This one is the shell; OptionsWidgets.lua is the schema-row -> AceGUI
-- translation and the two-column flow engine; OptionsScroll.lua is the always-shown scrollbar
-- patch. They are one major because they are one feature: a host that ended up with a shell from
-- one vendored copy and a flow engine from another would build panels that lay out wrong, and
-- there is no version negotiation that would catch it.
--
-- The basenames are namespaced (OptionsWidgets, not Widgets) because tests/test_versioning.lua
-- searches one shared CHANGELOG.md for "<FileBasename> minor <N>". Two majors owning a file called
-- Widgets.lua would satisfy each other's assertion, silently.
--
-- What the host keeps: which pages exist, what each one draws, and where a value lives. All of
-- that arrives as descriptor callbacks, so the library never learns a path, a page name or a
-- database. Depends on LibStub and LibKa0s-Core-1.0, and on no addon framework — AceGUI-3.0 is
-- resolved through LibStub at panel-build time and its absence is survivable, which is not the

--- Build one host's options surface.

--- Descriptor (`d`):

---   mainPanelName   string     frame name for the main canvas, so /framestack attributes it.
---   print(line)                where a user-facing line goes. Pass the host's tagged printer.
---   get(path)                  read a stored value.
---   set(path, value)           write one. Route it through the host's single write seam, so a
---                              panel change takes the same path a slash command does.
---   applyDefault(row)          reset one row. Same reasoning.
---   rowsForPage(pageKey, filter)  the rows of one page, in render order.
---   allRows()                  every row, for RestoreAllDefaults.
---   skipRestoreAll(row)        optional. Return true to exclude a row from a global reset (a
---                              profiles page, where a reset would delete user data).
---   afterRestoreAll()          optional. Runs after the rows are reset and BEFORE the panels are
---                              refreshed, for state no schema row owns (a dragged frame's
---                              position). Ordering matters: a refresh first would paint the
---                              pre-hook values.
---   scheduleTimer(fn, delay)   optional. Backs the color picker's 50 ms drag throttle. A
---                              descriptor field rather than an AceTimer embed, because embedding
---                              would be this library's second dependency-budget breach.
---   getLSM()                   optional. Returns LibSharedMedia-3.0, for LSMValues.
---   validate()                 optional. Runs once, before the page builders.
---   onAceGUI(AceGUI)           optional. Handed the resolved AceGUI so the host can stash it
---                              (Ka0s standard §3.4) for its own page files.
---   buildMain(ctx)             optional. Draws the main page's body on its first OnShow.
---   colorDecode(stored)        optional. -> r, g, b, a. Defaults to the {r=,g=,b=,a=} shape.
---   colorEncode(r, g, b, a)    optional. -> stored. Defaults to the same.
