# Test Cases

The full inventory of every headless test case in this repo, grouped by the suite file it
lives in. The `## Totals` table below is the **authoritative pass count** — the README test
badge and any count quoted in the docs must agree with it.

**Generated — do not hand-edit.** Regenerate with `lua tests/run.lua --list > docs/test-cases.md`.
